  situation: {
    summary:
      "The Bothnian Democratic Republic (BDR) has launched an offensive against the baltic states, in the first month Estonia has fallen and two Division Tactical Groups (DTGs) push through Latvia. The Latvian government has been evacuated from Riga and a defensive line is being formed to its south. \n\n JTF Brunsum has been initiated by NATO in response to this incursion. The Bothnian forces have established a perimeter to the south of RIGA as  they look to resupply for the second phase of the offensive. Our objective is to halt the current offensive and allow NATO to finish Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration (RSOI) of the force structure to enable the transition to the offensive. The initial offensive will involve the re-capture of Riga enabling a transition to a full counterattack into Latvia and Estonia.",
    aoSummary:
      "The III Corps area of operations concerns the land areas straddling the Latvian Lithuanian borders. The Northern Boundary is PL AQUA which extends from north of Riga to the Donovian Border. Our Eastern Boundary runs south along the Donovian and Belarussian Border where it eventually interacts PL TAN. The southern border runs along PL TAN between Kaunas and Vilnius on the Belorussian border. The Corps shares the western border with MNC-NE. It continues from Kaunas to PL Aqua.",
    aiSummary:
      "The III Corps area of interest includes the territory as indicated in the AO stretching past PL AQUA and inwards to PL RED (Estonia - Latvia Border) where the enemy has established a support zone and is staging the 61st and 64th DTGs to the North. To our East there is also concern about the potential assembly areas for the Donovian forces. To our West the CORPS is concerned about the potential for flanking maneuvers south of the Daugava river along the corridor between PL BLUE and PL PURPLE. To our South Main supply routes into PL TAN from Poland must be maintained as they could be threatened by Donovia or Belorussian forces.",

  mission: {
    statement:

Simultaneously block enemy attacks on AA5 to protect the flank of MNC-NE and prevent the enemy from disrupting our force generation in AA GOLD and PLATINUM",
  },
  execution: {
    commandersIntent:
      "The purpose of this operation is to allow NATO to finish RSOI of the force structure to transition to the offense and begin counterattacks to relieve RIGA. At end state Bothnian forces have failed to penetrate PL BROWN and III Corps maintain civil security of DAUGAVPILS and the CORPS is prepared to launch a counterattack to clear enemy south of the Daugava River.",
    conceptOfOperations:
      "The III Corps will conduct an area defense from PL PURPLE to PL BROWN with two divisions abreast. 10th Infantry Division in the east and 4th Infantry Division in the west. Key tasks include holding the city of Daugavpils and prevention of enemy flaking maneuvers in AA5. \n\n This operation is expected to last from C+68 to C+75.",
